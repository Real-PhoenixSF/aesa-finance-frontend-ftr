              relatively good time to consider purchasing residential real
              estate (especially single-family housing units). Housing prices

              <span class="TwelveMChangeH"></span> in the last 5 years. Take
              this data into account depending on how long you plan to hold your
              real estate investment or whether it is intended to be your
              primary residence.
